%description
Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.
Many new features have been added: multi‐level undo, syntax high‐
lighting,  command  line  history,  on‐line help, spell checking,
filename completion,  block  operations,  script  language,  etc.
There  is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI) available. Still,
Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi  "in  the  fin‐
gers"  will feel at home. See runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt for differ‐
ences with Vi.

This editor is very useful for editing programs and  other  plain
text  files.  All commands are given with normal keyboard charac‐
ters, so those who can type with ten fingers can work very  fast.
Additionally,  function keys can be mapped to commands by the us‐
er, and the mouse can be used.

%description enhanced
Install  the  vim‐enhanced package if you’d like to use a version
of the VIM editor which includes recently added enhancements like
interpreters for the Python and Perl scripting languages.  You’ll
also need to install the vim‐common package.

%description common
The vim‐common package contains files which every VIM binary will
need in order to run.

If you are installing vim‐enhanced or vim‐X11, you’ll  also  need
to install the vim‐common package.
